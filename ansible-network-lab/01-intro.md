# Ansible for Network Automation

Automation in network management has become crucial in modern IT environments, and understanding the models and tools available is essential for network engineers. This introduction will guide you through the fundamentals of Ansible automation, emphasizing its practical advantages and ease of adoption, especially for those without extensive programming skills.

Ansible initially focused on managing servers but has since extended its capabilities to include network devices. The core concepts, including modules and playbooks, remain consistent between server and network management, though there are some differences tailored to network automation. This expansion allows for a unified approach to managing both servers and network equipment, streamlining IT operations and improving efficiency.

### What is a Push Model?

In automation, a push model refers to a system where the central server sends commands or configurations directly to managed nodes. Ansible operates on a push model, meaning it pushes configurations from a central control machine to the nodes it manages.

### What is a Pull Model?

Conversely, a pull model involves managed nodes periodically checking in with a central server to fetch and apply new configurations. This approach is often seen in tools like Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack.

### Ansible's Approach to Automation

Ansible is renowned for its simplicity and accessibility, particularly for network engineers who may not have a background in programming. Ansible operates in a procedural manner, where tasks are executed sequentially as defined in playbooks. This straightforward approach is enhanced by Ansibleâ€™s support for declarative models through technologies like NETCONF and RESTCONF, allowing for more flexible and scalable network management.

### Ease of Adoption for Network Engineers

For network engineers looking to automate tasks without diving into complex programming, Ansible is an excellent choice. The primary requirement is an understanding of YAML, the human-readable data serialization standard used to write Ansible playbooks. With YAML, network engineers can define tasks, configurations, and workflows in a clear and concise manner.

### Built-In Concurrency

One of Ansible's significant advantages over traditional Python scripting is its built-in concurrency. Ansible allows for parallel execution of tasks across multiple nodes, significantly speeding up deployment times and ensuring consistent configurations.

## Getting Started with Ansible for Network Automation

Ansible modules support a wide range of vendors, device types, and actions, so you can manage your entire network with a single automation tool. This versatility makes Ansible a powerful solution for network automation, allowing you to automate routine tasks and ensure consistency across your network infrastructure. Ansible handles communication between the control node and managed nodes through multiple protocols:

*   **network_cli by SSH:** A widely-used protocol for managing network devices, ensuring secure and reliable communication.
*   **netconf by SSH:** A protocol designed specifically for network management, offering enhanced capabilities for configuration and monitoring.
*   **httpapi by HTTP/HTTPS:** A flexible and efficient protocol for interacting with network devices that support RESTful APIs.

Network platforms supported by Ansible are:

*   **Arista: eos:** Providing robust automation capabilities for Arista's Extensible Operating System.
*   **Cisco: ios, iosxr, nxos:** Enabling comprehensive management of Cisco's diverse range of network operating systems, from traditional IOS to the advanced features of IOS-XR and NX-OS.
*   **Juniper: junos:** Facilitating powerful automation for Juniper's Junos OS, known for its flexibility and performance.
*   **VyOS: vyos:** Supporting automation for VyOS, an open-source network operating system, ideal for various networking tasks.

With Ansible's extensive support for different network platforms and protocols, you can streamline your network automation processes and achieve greater operational efficiency.

### Network Modules in Ansible

Unlike most Ansible modules, network modules do not run on the managed nodes due to the inability of most network devices to run Python. Instead, these modules are executed on the Ansible control node. This different methodology ensures that Ansible can still manage network devices effectively. Additionally, network modules use the control node as a destination for backup files, typically storing them in the backup directory under the playbook root directory. This approach allows Ansible to provide consistent network management and backup capabilities without the need for Python on the network devices themselves.

By leveraging Ansible, network engineers can streamline their workflows, reduce manual interventions, and achieve greater consistency and reliability in their network operations. This introduction sets the stage for exploring Ansible's capabilities and understanding how it can transform network management practices.

## Installation of Ansible

For detailed instructions on installing Ansible, refer to the [Ansible Lab Setup with KVM](ansible-server/01-intro.md) or [Ansible Installation on Vagrant-Managed Ubuntu](ansible-server/vagrant/ansible-installation-on-vagrant.md) guides.

---

### Privilege Escalation - Networking Device

As of Ansible 2.6, you can use the top-level Ansible parameter `become: yes` with `become_method: enable` to run a task, play, or playbook with escalated privileges on any network platform that supports privilege escalation.

### Establish a Manual Connection to a Managed Node

To confirm your credentials, connect to a network device manually and retrieve its configuration. Replace the sample user and device name with your real credentials. For example, for a router:

```bash
zolo@u22s:~$ ssh admin@172.16.10.11
(admin@172.16.10.11) Password:

r1#sh ip int bri
Interface                  IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
FastEthernet0/0            172.16.10.11    YES NVRAM  up                    up
FastEthernet0/1            unassigned      YES NVRAM  administratively down down
FastEthernet1/0            unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down
r1#exit
Connection to 172.16.10.11 closed.
```

### Run Your First Network Command (Ad-Hoc)

Instead of manually connecting and running a command on the network device, you can retrieve its configuration with a single, stripped-down Ansible command. For more details on ad-hoc commands, refer to the [Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands](ansible-server/ad-hoc-commands.md) guide.

```bash
zolo@u22s:~$ ansible all -i 172.16.10.12, -c network_cli -u admin -k -m ios_facts -e ansible_network_os=ios
SSH password:
172.16.10.12 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_net_api": "cliconf",
        "ansible_net_gather_network_resources": [],
        "ansible_net_gather_subset": [
            "default"
        ],
        "ansible_net_hostname": "core-sw",
        "ansible_net_image": "tftp://255.255.255.255/unknown",
        "ansible_net_iostype": "IOS",
        "ansible_net_model": "3725",
        "ansible_net_operatingmode": "autonomous",
        "ansible_net_python_version": "3.10.12",
        "ansible_net_serialnum": "FTX0945W0MY",
        "ansible_net_system": "ios",
        "ansible_net_version": "12.4(15)T14",
        "ansible_network_resources": {}
    },
    "changed": false
}
```

In this example, Ansible targets all hosts defined in the inventory, specifying a custom inventory file with `-i`, connecting using `network_cli` as the connection type with `-c`, authenticating with the username `admin` using `-u`, prompting for a password with `-k`, executing the `ios_facts` module to gather facts about IOS devices, and specifying the network platform as `ios` using `-e`.

### Key Parameters for Network Ad-Hoc Commands

*   `-i`: Specifies the list of managed nodes, separated by commas, or the path to an inventory file.
*   `-c`: Defines the connection type (e.g., `network_cli`, `netconf`).
*   `-u`: Specifies the username for authentication.
*   `-k`: Prompts for a password.
*   `-m`: Specifies the module name (e.g., `ios_facts`, `ios_command`).
*   `-e`: Defines additional variables, such as the network platform (`ansible_network_os`).

These ad-hoc commands provide quick and efficient ways to perform specific tasks across your network infrastructure using Ansible's versatile command-line interface.

## Ansible Configuration and Setting

Ansible supports several sources for configuring its behavior, including an ini file named `ansible.cfg`, environment variables, command-line options, playbook keywords, and variables. This flexibility allows users to customize and optimize Ansible for their specific environments and needs. For a detailed guide on Ansible configuration, refer to the [Ansible Configuration and Settings](ansible-network-lab/ansible-configuration-and-setting.md) guide.

### The Configuration File

Changes to Ansible's behavior can be made in a configuration file. Ansible will search for this configuration file in the following order:

1.  `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` (environment variable if set)
2.  `ansible.cfg` (in the current directory)
3.  `~/.ansible.cfg` (in the home directory)
4.  `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

Ansible will process the list and use the first configuration file it finds, ignoring all others. This hierarchical search allows for different configurations based on the context in which Ansible is being used.

### The ansible-config Utility

The `ansible-config` utility is a powerful tool for viewing, listing, or dumping the various settings available for Ansible. This utility helps users manage and understand their Ansible configurations effectively.

#### Viewing the Current Configuration

You can use the `ansible-config view` command to print the content of your current `ansible.cfg` file. For example:

```bash
zolo@u22s:~/ansible-networking-lab$ ansible-config view
[defaults]
inventory=./inventory.cfg
gathering=explicit
host_key_checking=false
deprecation_warnings=false
interpreter_python=auto
retry_files_enabled=false
```

This output reflects the exact settings in the `ansible.cfg` file for the current directory.

#### Dumping the Current Configuration

To dump all of Ansible's current configuration settings, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-config dump
```

This command provides a comprehensive view of all configuration settings, making it easier to troubleshoot and understand Ansible's behavior in your environment.

#### Listing All Parameters

To see a list of all different parameters, their default values, and the possible values you can set, use the `ansible-config list` command:

```bash
ansible-config list
```

This command is particularly useful for discovering configurable options and understanding the defaults that Ansible uses.

#### How Ansible Works - Precedence Rules

To give you maximum flexibility in managing your environments, Ansible offers many ways to control how Ansible behaves: how it connects to managed nodes and how it works once it has connected. If you use Ansible to manage a large number of servers, network devices, and cloud resources, you may define Ansible behavior in several different places and pass that information to Ansible in several different ways.

Ansible offers four sources for controlling its behavior. In order of precedence from lowest (most easily overridden) to highest (overrides all others), the categories are:

1.  **Configuration settings:** The settings in your `ansible.cfg` file.
2.  **Command-line options:** Flags and parameters passed directly in the command line when running Ansible commands.
3.  **Playbook keywords:** Directives specified within your playbooks that control how tasks are executed.
4.  **Variables:** Values defined in your inventory files, playbooks, or directly in tasks, often providing the most granular level of control.

Each category overrides any information from all lower-precedence categories. For example, a playbook keyword will override any configuration setting. Within each precedence category, specific rules apply. However, generally speaking, 'last defined' wins and overrides any previous definitions.

#### Example Configuration

Below is an example configuration file (`ansible.cfg`) that might be used in a typical lab setup:

```ini
[defaults]
inventory=./inventory.cfg
gathering=explicit
host_key_checking=false
deprecation_warnings=false
interpreter_python=auto
retry_files_enabled=false
```

*   **inventory:** Specifies the path to the inventory file.
*   **gathering:** Controls the gathering of facts; `explicit` means facts are only gathered when explicitly requested.
*   **host_key_checking:** Disables SSH key checking to avoid issues with new hosts.
*   **deprecation_warnings:** Disables deprecation warnings to reduce clutter in output.
*   **interpreter_python:** Automatically determines the Python interpreter to use.
*   **retry_files_enabled:** Disables the creation of retry files for failed playbook runs.

This configuration helps streamline Ansible's operation in a controlled lab environment, ensuring that tasks run smoothly without unnecessary interruptions or checks.

By understanding and utilizing the configuration options available in Ansible, you can tailor the tool to better fit your needs, improving efficiency and control over your automation tasks. The `ansible-config` utility further enhances this capability by providing clear insights into the current settings and available options.

### Ansible Inventory Setting

Inventory serves as the foundation for managing hosts within our infrastructure using Ansible. It consolidates information about target hosts, including their IP addresses or Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs). The simplest inventory is a single file with a list of hosts and groups. The default location for this file is `/etc/ansible/hosts`. You can specify a different inventory file at the command line using the `-i <path>` option or in configuration using `inventory`. For more details on inventory, refer to the [Ansible Inventory Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#how-to-build-your-inventory).

#### Formats for Inventory Files

You can create your inventory file in various formats, the most common being `INI` and [`YAML`](https://yaml.org/). For this tutorial, see my [GNS3 Lab Setup](https://github.com/sydasif/gns3-lab).

A basic INI format might look like this as per my lab setup:

```ini
[router]
172.16.10.11

[core]
172.16.10.12

[switch]
172.16.10.13
172.16.10.14
```

The headings in brackets are group names. These group names are used to classify hosts, allowing you to decide which hosts to control at specific times and for particular purposes.

To build an inventory file using DNS names instead of IP addresses, you would replace the IP with the DNS names of your devices. Here's how you can modify the example:

```ini
[router]
r1

[core]
core-sw

[switch]
access1
access2
```

Ensure that the DNS names you use are resolvable from the system where you are running Ansible. This means that your DNS settings should be correctly configured to resolve these names to the appropriate IP addresses.

Hereâ€™s that same basic inventory file in YAML format:

```yaml
all:
  children:
    router:
      hosts:
        172.16.10.11:
    core:
      hosts:
        172.16.10.12:
    switch:
      hosts:
        172.16.10.13:
        172.16.10.14:
```

In this YAML inventory, `all` is the top-level group that contains all hosts and groups. The `hosts` key under `all` lists each host along with its properties, such as `ansible_host`. The `children` key under `all` contains subgroups like `router`, `core`, and `switch`, each with their respective hosts. This structure ensures the inventory is organized and easily manageable.

> By default, we can also reference two groups without defining them. The `all` group targets all our hosts in the inventory, and `ungrouped` contains any host that isnâ€™t part of any user-defined group.

#### Defining Host Aliases

Another useful functionality is the option to define aliases for hosts in the inventory. For example, we can run Ansible against the host alias `core-sw` if we define it in the inventory as:

```ini
core-sw ansible_host=172.16.10.12
```

#### Inventory and Variables

An important aspect of Ansibleâ€™s setup is variable assignment and management. Ansible offers many different ways of setting variables, and defining them in the inventory is one of them.

##### Host Variables

For example, letâ€™s define variables for each host in our inventory:

```ini
[router]
r1 ansible_host=172.16.10.11 ansible_user=bob

[core]
core-sw ansible_host=172.16.10.12 ansible_user=joe
```

Ansible-specific connection variables suchs as `ansible_user` or `ansible_host` are examples of host variables defined in the inventory.

##### Group Variables

Similarly, variables can also be set at the group level in the inventory, offering a convenient way to apply variables to hosts with common characteristics:

```ini
[router]
r1 ansible_host=172.16.10.11 ansible_user=bob ansible_password=bob123

[core]
core-sw ansible_host=172.16.10.12 ansible_user=joe ansible_password=joe123

[campus:children]
router
core

[campus:vars]
ansible_network_os=ios
ansible_connection=network_cli
```

Although setting variables in the inventory is possible, itâ€™s usually not the preferred way. Instead, store separate host and group variable files to enable better organization and clarity for your Ansible projects. Note that host and group variable files must use the YAML syntax.

In the same directory where we keep our inventory file, we can create two folders named `group_vars` and `host_vars` containing our variable files. For example, we could have a file `group_vars/campus.yaml` that contains all the variables for the campus network:

```yaml
---
# group_vars/campus.yaml
ansible_user: admin
ansible_password: cisco
ansible_network_os: ios
ansible_connection: network_cli
```

Letâ€™s view the generated inventory with the command:

```bash
zolo@u22s:~/ansible-networking-lab$ ansible-inventory -i inventory.yaml --graph
@all:
  |--@ungrouped:
  |--@campus:
  |  |--@router:
  |  |  |--r1
  |  |--@core:
  |  |  |--core-sw
  |  |--@switch:
  |  |  |--access1
  |  |  |--access2

##################################################################################

zolo@u22s:~/ansible-networking-lab$ ansible-inventory -i inventory.yaml --host r1
{
    "ansible_connection": "network_cli",
    "ansible_host": "172.16.10.11",
    "ansible_network_os": "ios",
    "ansible_password": "cisco",
    "ansible_user": "admin",
    "hostname": "r1"
}
```

The command fetches information from our hosts/inventory file and creates several groups according to our configuration/setup.

#### Key Points About Inventory

1.  **Host Information:** Inventory files contain crucial information about target hosts, such as their IP addresses and connection variables.
2.  **Default Location:** The default location for the inventory file is `/etc/ansible/hosts`, though you can specify a different location as needed.
3.  **File Format:** Inventory can be written in either `INI` or `YAML` format, providing flexibility in structuring and organizing host information.
4.  **Grouping Hosts:** Group names, enclosed in brackets, serve to classify hosts based on common attributes or roles they fulfill within the infrastructure.
5.  **Special Groups:** The `campus` group is an example of a special group used for categorizing network devices, enabling targeted management of specific device types.
6.  **Default Groups:** Ansible includes two default groups, namely `all` and `ungrouped`. The `all` group encompasses every host defined in the inventory, while the `ungrouped` group comprises hosts that do not belong to any other group aside from `all`.

By leveraging the inventory, Ansible users can effectively organize, manage, and automate tasks across their infrastructure, streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency.

### Test Your Ansible Setup - Playbook

A playbook is Ansible's configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. Each playbook is composed of one or more *plays* in a list. One *play* is a collection of one or more *tasks*, and a *task* is a single action that you want to execute through Ansible. In this section, we'll create a basic playbook to gather facts from an IOS device and display them using Ansible's debug module.

Here's an example playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: "Playbook-1: Get ios facts"
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  connection: network_cli

  tasks:
    - name: "P1T1: Get config from ios_facts"
      ios_facts:
        gather_subset: all

    - name: "P1T2: Display debug message"
      debug:
        msg: "The {{ ansible_net_hostname }} has {{ ansible_net_iostype }} platform"
```

Let's break down the playbook:

1.  **Playbook Definition**: The playbook starts with `---` to denote the beginning of a YAML document. Each playbook consists of one or more plays.

2.  **Play Name**: The play is named "Playbook-1: Get ios facts". This is for your reference and helps identify the purpose of the play.

3.  **Hosts**: The `hosts` directive specifies the target devices for this play. In this case, `all` means it will run on all hosts defined in your inventory.

4.  **Gather Facts**: `gather_facts: false` means that Ansible's default fact-gathering mechanism is disabled. Instead, we'll use the `ios_facts` module to gather facts.
5.  **Connection Type**: `connection: network_cli` indicates that the play will use CLI to connect to network devices.
6.  **Tasks**: Each play consists of a list of tasks. In this play, we have two tasks:
    *   **P1T1: Get config from ios_facts**: This task uses the `ios_facts` module to gather all possible facts from the IOS device. `gather_subset: all` means we are gathering all available facts.
    *   **P1T2: Display debug message**: This task uses the `debug` module to display a custom message that includes the gathered facts. The message is dynamically generated using Jinja2 templating, inserting the device's hostname (`ansible_net_hostname`) and platform type (`ansible_net_iostype`).

### Running the Playbook

To run this playbook, ensure you have your inventory file set up correctly. Execute the playbook with the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

```json
zolo@u22s:~/ansible-networking-lab$ ansible-playbook 01_play.yaml

PLAY [Playbook-1: Get ios facts] ********************************************************************************************************************

TASK [P1T1: Get config from ios_facts] **************************************************************************************************************
ok: [access1]
ok: [access2]
ok: [r1]
ok: [core-sw]

TASK [P1T2: Display debug message] ******************************************************************************************************************
ok: [r1] => {
    "msg": "The r1 has IOS platform"
}
ok: [access1] => {
    "msg": "The access1 has IOS platform"
}
ok: [core-sw] => {
    "msg": "The core-sw has IOS platform"
}
ok: [access2] => {
    "msg": "The access2 has IOS platform"
}
```

This command tells Ansible to run the playbook (`playbook.yml`) using the specified inventory file.

### Conclusion

Creating and running a simple Ansible playbook is a powerful way to automate tasks on network devices. This basic playbook gathers facts from an IOS device and displays them, providing a foundation you can build on for more complex automation workflows. Whether you're managing a small lab or a large production network, Ansible playbooks can help streamline your operations and reduce manual configuration efforts.
